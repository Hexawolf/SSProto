# ss-client

ss-client is a SSProto client that performs filesystem update operations similarly to rsync.

## What?

This applications connects to a server (ss-server) that implements SSProto, "indexes" (hashes) files in current
directory and sends list of files and their hashes to the server. After doing so, it listens to "update packets"
from the server. They contain files, their paths and signatures, that client need to download and save.

Basically, this application tries to keep working directory in synchronization with server. For example, if some
essential game files were modified on the server side, this client will download them from the server and game will be
compatible with it's game server again.

## Why?

SSProto is a really simple, hand-made protocol that was made because of all the problems that appeared with deploying
[Hexamine](https://hexawolf.me/hexamine) updates. Mainly, because people found installing updates (that were deployed
almost every day those days) too painful or even faced problems due to improper update as a result of customized client
setup. While ss-client is tuned specifically for Hexamine client, it is obvious that SSProto (as well as this
program) may be tuned for more applications where it is essential to keep only specific server files in sync with
clients.

## Is it secure?

All communications are secured by hardcoded TLS key. However, it is expected that received files may contain executable
data. For this reason, they are also signed by ed448-decaf key, which is fast enough if you care about the speed.
